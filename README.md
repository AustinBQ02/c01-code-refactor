# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This project is focused on learning how to approach refactoring code with an emphasis on web accessibility.

```
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
